<!-- {slushy}: A Bridge to the Future [TALK-1078] -->

<!-- Scaling the use of R can present complications for environment management, especially in regulated industries with a focus on traceability. One solution is controlled (aka "frozen") environments, which are carefully curated and tested by tech teams. However, the speed of R development means the environments quickly become outdated and users are unable to benefit from the latest advances. Enter {slushy}: a team-friendly tool powered by {renv} and Posit Package Manager. Users can quickly mimic a controlled environment, with the easy ability to time travel between snapshot dates. Attendees will learn how {slushy} bolstered our R adoption efforts, and how this strategy enables tech teams and users to work in parallel towards a common future. -->

<!-- Reliable Maintenance of Machine Learning Models [TALK-1083] -->

<!-- Maintaining machine learning models in production can be quite different from maintaining general software engineering projects, each with different challenges and common failure modes. In this talk, learn about model drift, the different ways the word "performance" is used with models, what you can monitor about a model, how feedback loops impact models, and how you can use vetiver to set yourself up for success with model maintenance. This talk will help practitioners who are already deploying models, but this is also useful knowledge for practitioners earlier in their MLOps journey; decisions made along the way can make the difference between resilient models that are easier to maintain and disappointing or misleading models. -->

<!-- CRAN-ial Expansion: Taking Your R Package Development to New Frontiers with R-Universe [TALK-1080] -->

<!-- Say goodbye to installation headaches and hello to a universe of possibilities with R-Universe! Take your R package development to new frontiers by organizing and sharing packages beyond the bounds of CRAN. R-Universe's reliable package-building process strengthens installation and usage instructions, resulting in fewer support requests and an easy installation experience for users. With webpages and an API for exploring packages, R-Universe creates a streamlined and tidy ecosystem for R-package constellations. Also, you can build a custom toolchain for your users, relieving your workload and empowering users to help themselves. Join me to learn how to explore the vastness of R-Universe and expand your package development possibilities! -->

<!-- In this talk, we'll learn how to leverage two Javascript projects, DuckDB-WASM and Observable's Plot.js, in our Shiny app to create fast, flexible interactive visualizations in the browser without burdening our app's server function -->

<!-- With the pointblank package itâ€™s really easy to methodically validate your data whether in the form of data frames or as database tables. On top of the validation toolset, the package gives you the means to provide and keep up-to-date with the information that defines your tables. -->
